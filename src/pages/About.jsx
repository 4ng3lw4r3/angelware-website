              I live sound and was awarded a degree in Audio Engineering and
              Production.

              My other obsession is Computer Science. I am coding websites for
              lovely people, and studying Artificial Intelligence.

              I was born to love. I find joy in expressing dance and song. I
              like to be in spa, beach, snow, nature and mountains. Like to
              taste negroni, kimchi and champagne, and smell terroni and ocean.
              <br />

              I believe in a Solar Punk futuristic human setting. I wish our
              civilization will be free from greedy entities and not leave Earth
              in flames.

              I was lucky enough to be introduced to building modular
              synthesizers by my friend. It is quite a part of my life too, and
              hopefully, I will create my electronic instrument named Angelware.

              Thank you for visiting, and have the most beautiful day, Angel.
