    Previously known as Reyna Deyna or DJ Rugile, my sounds
    are archived online. Good music and sound design are my life. I was awarded a degree 
    in Audio Engineering and Production. For me, the beauty of sound is not only
    psychological or societal. As much as I do not want, I sometimes probably love
    the physics of it more. I was warned that once I step into it, I will
    never hear music the same way again. I miss the old times when I could
    just feel it in my whole heart, blast my ears, but maybe I was just
    a teen. However, I deeply understand the significance of sound in
    our lives, recognizing its remarkable ability to heal, uplift, and
    connect us on a profound level.

    My other obsession is Computer Science. I was learning web development full
    stack and still coding some projects. Currently, I am studying
    Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I believe in
    a Solar Punk futuristic human setting. I wish our civilization will be free from
    greedy entities and not leave Earth in flames. I know, in my
    delufesto, I am saying that we live in a simulated reality; however,
    we are here and we must care for what's 'real' here. We just cannot be
    knowing that one can live off others' suffering or invade their privacy, no matter
    what material.

    I was lucky enough to be introduced to building modular synthesizers by my friend.
    It is quite a part of my life too, and hopefully, I will share more of it as entertainment.
    But for now, it is listed online for those interested in getting some.
